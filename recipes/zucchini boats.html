      <h1>Steps</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Step 1 Preheat oven to 350°. Score zucchini (like you’re dicing an
          avocado) and scoop out insides with a small spoon, leaving a ¼”-thick
          border intact. Chop zucchini pulp and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 2 Place zucchini boats in a large baking dish and drizzle all
          over with oil. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle thyme on top.
          Bake until tender, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 3 In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shrimp
          and season with salt and pepper. Cook until pink and cooked through, 3
          to 4 minutes. Remove from heat, let cool, then chop into bite-size
          pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 4 Return skillet to medium heat and melt remaining 1 tablespoon
          butter. Add reserved zucchini pulp, tomatoes, and garlic, season with
          salt and pepper, and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add cream,
          Parmesan, and lemon juice, and cook until slightly reduced, 3 minutes.
          Remove from heat and fold in cooked shrimp.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 5 Fill zucchini boats with shrimp mixture and top with
          mozzarella. Bake until cheese is bubbly, about 10 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 6 Garnish with more Parmesan and parsley, if desired, before
          serving.
        </li>
      </ul>
