      <ul>
        <li>
          Step 1 Preheat oven to 400Â°. In a small saucepan, prepare rice
          according to package instructions. In a large skillet over medium
          heat, heat oil. Cook onion until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato
          paste and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add
          ground beef and cook, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until no
          longer pink, 6 minutes. Drain fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 2 Return beef mixture to skillet, then stir in cooked rice and
          diced tomatoes. Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Let simmer
          until liquid has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Step 3 Place peppers cut side-up in a 9"-x-13" baking dish and drizzle
          with oil. Spoon beef mixture into each pepper and top with Monterey
          jack, then cover baking dish with foil./li>
        </li>

        <li>
          Step 4 Bake until peppers are tender, about 35 minutes. Uncover and
          bake until cheese is bubbly, 10 minutes more.
